 <h3>Welsh Cenre for International Affairs</h3>
 <p>I want a Wales where everything we do here to improve our lives also protects people around the world and our shared planet. I want people to be paid fairly and treated well when making and growing the things we buy here in Wales. I want us to help each other out in times of crisis and I want people in Wales to have chances to learn from and share ideas with people all over the world so we can face the challenges of inequality, poverty and the climate and nature emergencies together.
